It can be difficult and hurtful when someone doesn’t like you. It’s important to remember that not everyone will like everyone else, and it doesn’t necessarily mean that there’s something wrong with you. It’s more likely that this person just has their own personal preferences or issues that they’re dealing with. How did you find out this person doesn’t like you?\n I have two roommates, let’s call them A and B.Today A said she wanted to go to a restaurant for lunch, so I told her we can go together. She said she wanted to ask B if she was going. B said she won’t go, so I think the two of us will go. As a result, A said that she had to consider whether to go. Then B suddenly said that she had time, and A said that the three of us should go to dinner together.So A doesn’t want to be alone with me? It made me feel a little excluded.  Oh wow, that can definitely be hurtful. It’s understandable why you might feel that way, and your feelings are valid. It does seem like A is going out of her way to avoid spending time with you one-on-one, which can be confusing and upsetting. Have you noticed any other signs that A doesn’t want to spend time with you alone, or is this the first time something like this has happened?\n I recalled that A and I had never been together. Either the three of us, me and B, or A and B.  That can definitely be a red flag. If A has consistently avoided spending time with you one-on-one, it may be worth considering that she might not be as invested in the friendship as you are. It’s possible that there could be some underlying issues or reasons why A isn’t comfortable spending time alone with you, and it might be worth having a conversation with her to see if there’s anything going on. Do you feel comfortable talking to A about this situation, or do you think it might be better to just let it go?\n I’m worried that if I talk to her about this and get the answer that she really doesn’t like me, it will be awkward for us to live together.  That’s a valid concern. Talking about these kinds of issues can be tricky, and you don’t want to make your living situation even more uncomfortable. However, it’s also important to consider your own feelings in this situation. Living with someone who doesn’t like you can be very difficult and emotionally draining, and it might be better to get everything out in the open now rather than let it fester and potentially get worse. If you do decide to talk to A, it might be helpful to use “I” statements (like “I feel excluded when you don’t want to spend time with me alone”) to avoid sounding accusatory. Do you think that could be a good approach?\n yes, it sounds like a good approach. but what if she really doesn’t like me?  If A admits that she doesn’t like you, it will be hard to hear, but at least you will have the truth. That could give you the opportunity to work on improving your relationship with A, or it could mean that it might be best to limit your interactions with her. Remember that just because A doesn’t like you doesn’t mean that there’s anything wrong with you. It’s more likely that it’s just a matter of personal preference. It’s important to try not to take it too personally, and to focus on the relationships that do make you feel valued and appreciated. Regardless of what happens with A, it might be a good idea to focus on spending more time with your other roommate, B, or to look for other people to spend time with who make you feel good about yourself.\n you’re right. i will try to talk to her. I have always had a problem. In interpersonal relationships, I am always the one who takes the initiative. I take the initiative to say anything. This makes me feel that I am the only one maintaining the relationship. But after I told the other person how I felt, the other person didn’t give me any feedback.Am I too emotional?  It’s understandable to feel like you’re the one always putting in the effort in your relationships, especially when you don’t feel like your efforts are being reciprocated. But it doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re being too emotional. It could just mean that you’re a very caring person who values your relationships. However, it’s important to remember that not everyone expresses their feelings in the same way, and not everyone has the same level of emotional awareness. Some people might not realize that their lack of initiative is making you feel unappreciated, and they may need you to communicate with them about it. Have you tried directly asking your friends for feedback or letting them know that you’d like them to take more initiative in your relationship?\n I seemed to have overlooked this. I always took the initiative to tell them how I felt, but never asked them how they felt or asked them to give me feedback directly.  It’s very easy to fall into the habit of always sharing your feelings and never asking for feedback, especially if you’re someone who’s used to being the “caretaker” in your relationships.But it’s important to remember that relationships are a two-way street, and that it’s okay to ask for what you need from your friends. One thing you could try is to say something like, “I really value our friendship, and I want to make sure that I’m not overwhelming you with my emotions. Can you let me know if there’s anything I’m doing that bothers you, or if there’s anything I can do to be a better friend to you?” This kind of direct communication can help you to understand your friends better, and it can also help you to feel more secure in your relationships.\n Thank you so much, what you said is very helpful to me, I will try it! bless me.  You’re welcome. I’m glad I could help. And yes, I’m rooting for you! Remember to be patient and understanding, and to be kind to yourself throughout this process.
